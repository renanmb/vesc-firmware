# VESC Configurations
These configuration files are for version 4.12 of the VESC hardware. This will *NOT* work with VESC 6.0!!!!

For VESC versions (i.e. everything except for VESC-X (FOCBOX) ), the MIT team recommends using the `6.141_bldc_old_hw_30k_erpm.xml` VESC config.

For the VESC-X (FOCBOX), the 6.141 team recommends the `6.141_bldc_VESC_X_hw_30k_erpm.xml` VESC config.

For convenience, more simply named duplicate configs are: FOCBOX_hw_30k_erpm.xml for the FOCBOX, and VESC_30k_erpm.xml for the VESC 4.12 and clones.
